# ML_from_scratch
Machine learning algorithms from scratch.
Some of the algorithms are unfinished and the code structure is likely to change.

Finshed algorithms:
  KMeans clustering: Partitions n observations into k clusters based on relative distance to cluster centers.
  KNN (k-nearest neighbours): Test points are classified by majority vote of the nearby training points. It is recommmended that k is an odd number.
  DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise):Groups together points that are closely packed together (points      with many nearby neighbours), marking any outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions 
  
  Unfinished:
    Feed forward neural network
